## Input/Output Format

### Searching Problems (Week 1 & 2):
```
Input:
T (number of test cases)
For each test case:
n (size of array)
n space-separated integers
key (element to search)

Output:
For each test case:
"Present" or "Not Present"
Number of comparisons
```

### Sorting Problems (Week 3 & 4):
```
Input:
T (number of test cases)
For each test case:
n (size of array)
n space-separated integers

Output:
For each test case:
Sorted array
Number of comparisons
Number of swaps/shifts/inversions
```

## How to Use

1. **Clone the repository:**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/dsa-4th-sem-mid-practical.git
```

2. **Navigate to the specific week's folder:**
```bash
cd week1  # or week2, week3, etc.
```

3. **Compile and run the programs:**
```bash
g++ program.cpp -o program
./program
```

## Time Complexities

| Algorithm        | Best Case | Average Case | Worst Case |
|-----------------|-----------|-------------|------------|
| **Linear Search** | O(1) | O(n) | O(n) |
| **Binary Search** | O(1) | O(log n) | O(log n) |
| **Jump Search** | O(âˆšn) | O(âˆšn) | O(âˆšn) |
| **Insertion Sort** | O(n) | O(nÂ²) | O(nÂ²) |
| **Selection Sort** | O(nÂ²) | O(nÂ²) | O(nÂ²) |
| **Merge Sort** | O(n log n) | O(n log n) | O(n log n) |
| **Quick Sort** | O(n log n) | O(n log n) | O(nÂ²) |
